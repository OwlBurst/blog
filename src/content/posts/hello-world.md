Welcome to our little corner of the internet!

We are Cosmic System (they/he), or Cosmic for short. Elsewhere you might also find us using different other aliases, such as Owl Burst, Sunnie, or maybe something else I couldn't remember when I'm writing this.

On the pages of this, now empty, website, in the future you might find rants about anything from development to trains and anything that we might find interesting. Mostly probably development though.

In the meantime though, have a magical day out there! See you real soon!
